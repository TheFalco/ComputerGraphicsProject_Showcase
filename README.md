# Showcase
_This repository has been created as part of the "Computer Graphics" course at Politecnico di Milano._

## Description

Imagine a shop window in which there are several objects on pedestals.
You will have to present several pedestals with objects showing off different rendering techniques. It must be possible to select (with the keyboard) one of the pedestals to inspect it more closely.
